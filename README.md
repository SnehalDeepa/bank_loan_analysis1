# bank_loan_analysis1

## Overview
This project aims to analyze a bank's loan dataset to identify patterns and factors that distinguish good loans from bad loans. By leveraging Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, the analysis focuses on deriving actionable insights to optimize risk assessment, improve loan approval processes, and enhance overall financial decision-making

## Objective
**Objective of Bank Loan Analysis Project**:  

The objective of the Bank Loan Analysis project is to analyze loan data to identify patterns and trends in good and bad loans, enabling the bank to make data-driven decisions to minimize risks and improve profitability. By examining factors such as loan amounts, interest rates, borrower profiles, creditworthiness, and repayment patterns, the project aims to:  
1. Classify loans into "good" and "bad" categories based on repayment behavior.  
2. Identify key factors influencing loan defaults.  
3. Provide actionable insights to optimize the loan approval process.  
4. Enhance risk assessment models to improve the bankâ€™s lending strategy.  
5. Visualize data trends for effective communication with stakeholders.  

This analysis will help the bank in mitigating risks, improving customer segmentation, and maximizing financial returns while maintaining a healthy loan portfolio.

## Project SQL Schema

**Data Overlook**:
```sql
select * from bank_loan_data;
```
**Counting rows**:
By using COUNT function
```sql
select COUNT(id) AS Total_Applications from bank_loan_data;
```

**month to date total loan application**:
```sql
select COUNT(id) AS MTD_Total_Loan_Applications from bank_loan_data
where MONTH(issue_date) = 12 AND year(issue_date) = 2021;
```

**previous month to date total loan application**:
```sql
select COUNT(id) AS PMTD_Total_Loan_Applications from bank_loan_data
where MONTH(issue_date) = 11 AND year(issue_date) = 2021;
```

**total funded amount received from data**:
```sql
select SUM(total_payment) as Total_Amount_Received from bank_loan_data;
```

**month to date total payment of loan**:
```sql
select sum(total_payment) AS MTD_Total_Amount_Applications from bank_loan_data
where MONTH(issue_date) = 12 AND year(issue_date) = 2021;
```

**previous month to date total payment of loan**:
```sql
select sum(total_payment) AS PMTD_Total_Amount_Applications from bank_loan_data
where MONTH(issue_date) = 11 AND year(issue_date) = 2021;
```

**current month to average date**:
```sql
select round(AVG(int_rate)*100, 2) as MTD_Avg_Interest_Rate from bank_loan_data
where month(issue_date) = 12 and year(issue_date) =2021;
```

**previous month to date average date**:
```sql
select round(AVG(int_rate)*100, 2) as PMTD_Avg_Interest_Rate from bank_loan_data
where month(issue_date) = 11 and year(issue_date) =2021;
```

### dti should not very much high or not very much low

**Debt to income ratio**:
```sql
SELECT ROUND(avg(dti)*100, 2) as MTD_Avg_DTI FROM bank_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) =12 and year(issue_date) = 2021
```

**FOR PREVIOUS MONTH debt to income ratio**:
```sql
SELECT ROUND(avg(dti)*100, 2) as PMTD_Avg_DTI FROM bank_loan_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 11 and year(issue_date) = 2021
```

**find loan status**
```sql
select loan_status from bank_loan_data
```

## good loan ={[count of (fully paid loan status and current loan status)]/ [count(id)]}*100:

```sql
select
     (COUNT(case when loan_status ='Fully Paid' or loan_status = 'Current' then id end)*100)
	 /
	 COUNT(id) as Good_loan_percentage
from bank_loan_data;
```

**good loan application**:
```sql
select count(id) as Good_Loan_Applications from bank_loan_data
where loan_status = 'Fully Paid' or loan_status = 'Current';
```

**find the good loan funded amount meand the loan amount**
```sql
select sum(loan_amount) as Good_Loan_Funded_Amount from bank_loan_data
where loan_status = 'Fully Paid' or loan_status = 'Current';
```

**ind god loan total received amount**:
```sql
select sum(total_payment) as Good_Loan_amount_received from bank_loan_data
where loan_status = 'Fully Paid' or loan_status = 'Current';
```

### BAD LOAN RECEIVED

**Bad loan percentage**:
```sql
select
     (COUNT(case when loan_status ='Charged Off' then id end)*100)
	 /
	 COUNT(id) as Bad_loan_percentage
from bank_loan_data;
```

**total applications of bad loan**:
```sql
select count(id) as Bad_Loan_Applications from bank_loan_data
where loan_status='charged Off'
```

**bad loan funded amount**:
```sql
select sum(total_payment) as Bad_Loan_Funded_Amount from bank_loan_data
where loan_status='charged Off';
```

**LOAN STATUS**:

SELECT 
      loan_status, 
	  count(id) as Total_Loan_Applications,
	  SUM(total_payment) as Total_Amount_Received,
	  SUM(loan_amount) as Total_Funded_Amount,
	  AVG(int_rate *100) as Interest_Rate,
	  AVG(dti * 100) as DTI
